This patch was designed to be run on [ROLI's Lightpad Block / Lightpad Block M](https://roli.com/products/blocks/lightpad-block).  It is written in [Littlefoot](https://support.roli.com/support/solutions/articles/36000019133-what-is-littlefoot-)!
To run this on your Lightpad:
1. Install and open the [ROLI Dashboard](https://roli.com/products/software/blocks-dashboard). 
2. Download the `.littlefoot` file from this repository.
3. In ROLI Dashboard, Click `File`, followed by `Open`.  Select the file downloaded in step 2.
4. You will be asked if you'd like the patch to be added to the list of applications - it's easiest to say yes.
5. With your Block plugged in, you should be able to select the application from the list.  It will automatically load on the device!
