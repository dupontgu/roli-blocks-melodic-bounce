This patch was designed to be run on [ROLI's Lightpad Block](https://roli.com/products/blocks/lightpad-block).  It is written in their proprietary Littlefoot language.  To run this on your Lightpad, first install and run [BLOCKS Code](https://juce.com/blocks/code).  With your device plugged in, click `File`, followed by `New File`.  Copy and paste the code from the .littlefoot file in this directory into the editor in the BLOCKS Dashboard.  The program should automatically load on to your Lightpad upon saving.  If not, you can manually compile/upload from the `Compile` menu. Feel free to make a pull request with any changes you make - I'd love to hear from other users.
