This patch was designed to be run on [ROLI's Lightpad Block](https://roli.com/products/blocks/lightpad-block).  It is written in their proprietary Littlefoot language.  To run this on your Lightpad, first install and run the [BLOCKS Dashboard software](https://roli.com/article/introducing-blocks-dashboard).  With your device plugged in, click `File`, followed by `New Program`.  Copy and paste the code from the .littlefoot file in this directory into the editor in the BLOCKS Dashboard.  The program should automatically load on to your Lightpad.  Feel free to make a pull request with any changes you make - I'd love to hear from other users.
